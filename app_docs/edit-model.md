# Edit Model: Word-Anchored Format, Style Preset, HarfBuzz Builder, Versions

**Specifications:**

- specs/issue-31-adw-7f81a19d-sdlc_planner-edit-model-builder-versions.md

Every edit of a reel is a small JSON file (`edit.json`) anchored to the words of its transcript.
One builder turns it into a HyperFrames page, the same bytes in the worker and in the studio, and
every saved edit is an immutable version.

## Overview

`packages/edit` (`@edit-issebya/edit`) holds the edit format, the issebya style preset, the
HarfBuzz builder with its layout checks, and the version operations. It is TypeScript source with
no build step and no platform API (no `fs`, no DOM, no clock, no randomness): the caller passes in
everything that touches the platform (the HarfBuzz module and font bytes, storage, the database,
new ids). `apps/worker` consumes it now (the `first_version` step); `apps/studio` imports only its
types until slice 9 brings the live preview.

## How it works

### Format

- `src/schema.ts`: `edit.json`, format 1: `format`, `preset` (`"issebya"`), `duration`, `inputs`
  (the pipeline outputs it was made from, each `{ step, fingerprint, file }`: `footage`,
  `transcript`, `cutout`, `head_track`) and `tracks`: `footage`, `cutout`, `captions`, `overlays`
  (`kind: "accent"`), `transitions` (`dim`, `panel`, `card`) and `sounds` (`click`).
- Every item has an `id` (`^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,63}$`, unique across tracks), a `start` and an `end`
  anchor. An anchor is a word (`{ word, edge?: "start" | "end", offset? }`, offset within plus or
  minus 1 s), a time in seconds (`{ time }`, only where nobody speaks) or the reel's edge
  (`{ reel: "start" | "end" }`). Anchors are resolved at every build (`src/timeline.ts`,
  `resolveAnchor`, `resolveTimeline`, to the millisecond), so items follow their words through a
  re-time.
- Per-item properties: captions and overlays take `words`, `text`, `font` (`primary` or
  `secondary`), `size`, `color` (`#RRGGBB`) and `position` (`{ x, y, align }` inside the frame);
  footage and cut-out clips take `hidden` spans; transitions a replacement `color`; sounds
  `gain_db` (-60 to 12). Unset properties come from the preset.
- `style` is the free custom-style field: CSS property to value, added to the element. Values
  cannot leave the style attribute (no `;`, `{`, `}`, `<`, `>`, backslash or `url(`).
- Validation is Zod 4. `editSchemaFor(preset, transcript)` is built per reel: word ids are the
  transcript's and fonts the preset's, so an unknown word or font is refused by the schema itself;
  a refinement refuses a duplicate id, an end before its start and an overlay with neither words
  nor text. `src/transcript.ts` is the studio transcript (`{ words: [{ id, text, start, end }] }`).

### Preset values

`src/preset.ts`, `ISSEBYA_PRESET`, the values of the approved `rethink-work` reel:

- Frame 1080x1920; safe box left 130, right 860, top 260, bottom 1400. Text never leaves it.
- Fonts: `primary` Raleway Light (`assets/fonts/Raleway-Light.ttf`, weight 300, 110 px) for
  accents, `secondary` Golos Text Bold (`assets/fonts/GolosText-Bold.ttf`, weight 700, 50 px) for
  captions.
- Captions: `#FFFFFF`, rise 12 px over 0.18 s (`power2.out`), fade out 0.15 s, at least 0.25 s on
  screen, a group breaks at a 0.35 s pause or after 4 units, fallback line y 1290 when no head is
  in the frame, line gap 14.
- Accents: `#B3E6FF`, 190 px above the head, y 1130 with no head. Slots beside the head: first row
  610, row gap 85, right drop 42, minimum left 110, minimum right 90.
- Transitions: `dim` (full frame, `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.62)`, fade 0.3 s), `panel` (y 1150 to 1920,
  `#121212`, slide 0.5 s `power3.inOut`, hides the cut-out), `card` (full frame,
  `rgba(8, 8, 8, 0.9)`, fade 0.25 s).
- Click sound: `assets/sounds/mouse-click-trimmed.wav`, 0.23 s, -13 dB, at least 0.25 s apart.
- Caption units: kept capitals (`I`, `I'm`, `I've`, `I'll`, `I'd`, `AI`), a number joined with the
  unit after it, a month with its day number, and the glossary (`lock-in`, heard as `locking` or
  `lock in`).

### Builder contract

- `src/build.ts`: `build(edit, transcript, headTrack, preset, measurer) -> { html, assets, checks }`.
  `html` is a HyperFrames composition (`data-composition-id="main"`, a paused GSAP 3.14.2 timeline
  registered on `window.__timelines`); `assets` lists every referenced file with its role
  (`footage`, `cutout`, `font`, `sound`), sorted; `checks` is the layout check list.
- Deterministic: no clock, no randomness, no I/O. The same inputs give the same bytes in Node and in
  the browser. One builder serves the preview and the export.
- `src/measure.ts`: `createMeasurer(hb, fonts)` over the initialised `harfbuzzjs` module and the
  font bytes, both passed in by the caller (the worker's `apps/worker/src/edit-measurer.ts` reads
  them from `packages/edit/assets/`, once per process). The `Measurer` returns advance widths
  (`sum(x_advance) * size / upem`) and records every width it measured (`widths()`, what the
  goldens compare). The same wasm on the same font bytes gives identical widths everywhere.
- `src/layout.ts` (`layoutText`) places every caption and accent from the measured widths and the
  head track; `src/html.ts` escapes text and attributes and formats numbers.

### Checks

`src/checks.ts`, `runChecks`, in a stable order, each failure `{ rule, item, reason }` with a
readable reason string (an empty list means every rule passes):

- `safe-box`: text inside the safe box (the edge and value that run past it).
- `face`: captions clear of the face (the face box from the head track).
- `sound-gap`: two sounds at least the preset's gap (0.25 s) apart.
- `time-in-speech`: a time anchor outside speech (it names the word to anchor to instead).
- `out-of-reel`: an anchor that resolved outside the reel and was clamped.

### Versions and restore

- `src/versions.ts`: a version's `edit.json` lives at
  `${R2_KEY_PREFIX}reels/<reel_id>/versions/<version_id>.json` (`versionKey`), its bytes the
  canonical JSON of the edit (`editBytes`), written with put-if-absent; an existing key fails the
  save (versions are never rewritten). Then `rows.save` writes the row. `saveVersion` and
  `restoreVersion` take `{ rows, blobs, keyPrefix, newId }`, so the package needs no randomness.
- Restore never rewrites history: `restoreVersion` creates a new version copying the old one's
  bytes, inputs and checks, its parent the current version, `restored_from_id` the old one and
  change summary `restored version <n>`.
- `apps/worker/src/version-store.ts`: `supabaseVersionRows(db)` (`current` reads
  `reels.current_version_id`, `get` reads named columns, `save` calls the `save_version` RPC) and
  `storageVersionBlobs(storage)` (JSON, put-if-absent).
- `supabase/migrations/20261101153653_versions.sql`: table `versions` (`id`, `reel_id`,
  `owner_id`, `number`, `parent_id`, `restored_from_id`, `request`, `model`, `prompt_version`,
  `change_summary`, `checks`, `inputs`, unique `r2_key`, `created_at`). Parent and restored-from
  must be versions of the same reel. `reels.current_version_id` names the current one. Trigger
  `versions_refuse_update` refuses every update, even for the service role; rows go only with their
  reel (cascade). Owner-only `select` RLS for `authenticated`, no `anon` access, in the
  `supabase_realtime` publication.
- `save_version(...)` (security definer) locks the reel, refuses a parent that is not the reel's
  current version (a stale or concurrent save), inserts the row with the reel's owner and the next
  `number`, makes it current and returns the number, in one transaction. Only `service_role` may
  execute it.

### First version

`src/baseline.ts`, `baselineEdit(transcript, { inputs, duration }, preset)`: the automatic first
version from the preset alone (no AI): footage and cut-out over the whole reel, one caption per
word or unit, starting on its own word and ending on the last word of its group; no positions
(the builder fills them), no accents, transitions or sounds.

`apps/worker/src/first-version.ts`, the `first_version` step after the six pipeline steps: reads
the retimed `transcript.json` and `retime.json` and the `head-track.json` by their fingerprints,
builds the baseline, runs `build` for its checks and saves version 1 (`request`, `model` and
`prompt_version` null, change summary `automatic first version from the issebya style`). Its step
line is `version 1 saved, <time>, <size>`. A reel that already has a version (a retried job) keeps
it: a hit, `first version kept, reused`, nothing written. Failed checks are stored on the row,
never fatal.

### Cross-environment test and negative proof

- `src/testdata/versions/` holds the stored fixture versions: `baseline-short-speech.edit.json`
  (the baseline over `fixtures/pipeline/`) and `rethink-work-hand.edit.json` (by hand, with
  accents, the `panel` transition and a click), with `src/testdata/rethink-work/` (its transcript
  and real head track). `src/test-support/fixtures.ts` imports them as JSON modules so both runs
  build exactly the same inputs.
- `src/build.test.ts` (Node, `measurer.node.ts`) and `src/build.browser.test.ts` (Chromium,
  `measurer.browser.ts`, the same wasm and fonts fetched from the test server) build every fixture
  and compare the page and the widths with the committed goldens in `src/testdata/golden/` byte for
  byte. The Node test also builds each fixture twice and expects the same result.
- Negative proof: during the run a temporary probe (never committed) swapped the browser
  measurer for canvas `measureText` with the same fonts loaded through `FontFace`; the browser
  comparison then failed, so the test detects a measurer that differs from HarfBuzz.
- `scripts/golden.ts` (`yarn workspace @edit-issebya/edit golden`) rewrites the baseline fixture
  version and every golden from the Node build. Commit what it writes.

## Testing

- `yarn turbo run test --filter=./packages/edit`: the `node` and `browser` Vitest projects
  (`vitest.config.ts`); the browser project needs Install step 3's chromium. `turbo.json` passes
  `PLAYWRIGHT_*` and `CI` through. Also schema, timeline, checks, baseline and versions tests, and a
  build of the 50-second hand edit under 200 ms.
- `apps/studio/db-tests/versions.test.ts` under `yarn test:db`: `save_version`, version
  immutability and its RLS.
- `apps/worker/src/first-version.test.ts` (version 1 saved, kept on a retry) and
  `apps/worker/src/edit-import.test.ts` (Node imports the package's TypeScript source).
- E2E: `apps/studio/e2e/upload.spec.ts` ends with `first_version: version 1 saved, ...`, the
  version row and its R2 key checked.

## Rules

- Never change a version: no update, no rewrite of its key. History is never rewritten; going back
  creates a new version.
- Never write a version key twice (put-if-absent, an existing key fails the save).
- Never let anything but the service role execute `save_version`.
- One builder for preview and export; never fork it per environment.
- Never store a built page; versions hold the edit, the page is built from it.
- Anchors are words; seconds only where nobody speaks.
- Nothing Node-only or browser-only in `packages/edit`; the caller injects the platform.
- Never commit an asset without its licence (`assets/fonts/OFL-*.txt`,
  `assets/sounds/LICENSE-sounds.md`).

## Notes

- The `number` column was added beyond the issue's list: it gives the per-reel "version N", and
  `unique (reel_id, number)` doubles as a guard against two concurrent saves.
- The studio imports only types from the package until slice 9.
- The fixture clip has no person, so the face rule is proven with a synthetic head track
  (`src/checks.test.ts`) and the `rethink-work` data.
